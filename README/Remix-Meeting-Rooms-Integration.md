# Remix Integration with Austin Public Library Website: Managing `/meeting-rooms`

This documentation outlines the process of exploring the integration of the Remix framework for managing specific routes, initially focusing on the `/meeting-rooms` route, which has been previously managed by the APL's Drupal website. The objective is to assess and potentially implement Remix as the new platform for this route to enhance functionality and user experience.

## Prerequisites
- Successful setup of the Remix sample application, as outlined in the initial README.
- Access to the repository at [APL Innovation Lab](https://github.com/APL-Innovation-Lab/aplcms-minus).

## Overview

The goal of this guide is to provide a structured approach to exploring how Remix can be used to manage the `/meeting-rooms` route on the Austin Public Library website. This involves understanding the current Drupal implementation, planning the migration, and potentially implementing the route within Remix to improve maintainability and scalability.

## Getting Started

### 1. Understand the Current Implementation
Analyze the existing `/meeting-rooms` route on the Drupal site to understand its functionality, user interactions, and data integrations. This will help in planning the transition without loss of features or data integrity.

### 2. Set Up the Remix Environment
Ensure you are connected to the latest Codespace instance for the APL development environment. You may need to retrieve the latest instance name from the APL GitHub repository's Codespace settings.

### 3. Plan the Remix Route Implementation
- Design the structure of the `/meeting-rooms` route in Remix to mimic or improve upon the Drupal version.
- Consider user flow, accessibility, and responsiveness in the design.

### 4. API Integration
- If the Drupal version of the route interacts with APIs for booking or information retrieval, plan how these will be handled in Remix.
- Securely migrate API interactions, ensuring that all sensitive data handling is compliant with security standards.

### 5. Develop and Test the New Route
- Implement the new `/meeting-rooms` route in the Remix application.
- Test thoroughly to ensure functionality matches or exceeds the Drupal site, with particular attention to user experience and data accuracy.

### 6. Feedback and Iteration
- Gather feedback from stakeholders and users familiar with the original Drupal route.
- Iterate on the design and functionality based on feedback to refine the user experience.

### 7. Documentation and Deployment
- Document the development process, challenges encountered, and solutions implemented.
- Prepare for deployment by setting up necessary configurations and ensuring all code is production-ready.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, developers will explore and potentially transition the management of the `/meeting-rooms` route from Drupal to Remix, aiming to enhance the scalability and maintainability of the APL website. This process will serve as a pilot for possibly migrating more routes to Remix in the future.
